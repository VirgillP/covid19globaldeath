# About Julia programming language, in my own experience so far

Julia is really easy to use and the syntax is amazingly user-friendly. I haven't seen odd or cryptic syntax that would leave me scratching my head for answers. Having coded in Ruby I can see the similarity in syntax as well. Much of Julia's functions are build in and the same can be said about the help documentation. Julia makes use of packages. These are build in functions, modules which freeing up the developer to focus on the problem at hand. Overall this is an amazing programming language to learn and experiment with. And yes it is open source too.

# Covid19

Using covid19 data from the Github COVID-19 Data Repository at Johns Hopkins University) a plot graph can be presented with Julia. The final plotted graph is an attempt (the result of my home work so far) to achieve the result as presented with the Julia Academy Data Science online course.

## Installation

The documentation on Julia (https://julialang.org/) is well documented making installation straightforward for the platform it is being used on. You should be familiar with the Windows CommandLine and MacOS- and Linux Terminal because packages and instructions are completed in those ways. With this project I use two build systems; Atom with Juno AKA JuliaPro and Visual Studio Code interchangeably. There is much on the internet to learn about the Julia programming language. Online courses and videos, lectures from Julia Academy and reading material are part of many resources one can make use of. And feel free to engage with the Julia community to learn more.

## Usage
My plotted graph has been tested on both Windows and MacOS platform.
Comments and how-I-got-to-do-it steps are available in the covid19globaldeath.jl file extension.
